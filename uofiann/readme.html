Here is a practical example of an artificial neural net (ANN) which runs over images from the U of I chest Xray collection. 
The sample size of a few thousand Xrays is too smal to build a seriously robust ANN, however the code is provided as an example of how an ANN can be built quickly and efficiently. 
The training data are available online- look up in the readme for the repository.
