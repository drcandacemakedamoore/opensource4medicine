Open source programs useful in medicine. Also check the repositories for Debora and Neuromath of mine: those are primitive, but innovative in terms of how I look at histogram bins.
I am in the process of adding lisences to everything.

The programs in this repository that refer to the University of Indiana Chest Xray set (i.e. uoficlassifynormalwritecsv2xl, popoutstringfromuofi 	and	uofindianacxrayclassifynormal) use data in this set for training data. The data can be downloaded off the internet at:

Note that programs using higher levels of NLP are now the property of Ikhami. NLP available in UofIani folder does not handle specific complex strings such as""resolution of previously described right midlung opacity", "resolution of previosly described opacity" as strings upon which to classify Xrays as it is possible to have a report that has a resolving opacitty in one area and the appearance of a new opacity in another. This level of complex NLP will be available through Ikhami in potentially commercial products.
